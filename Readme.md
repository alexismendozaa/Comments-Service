# ðŸ§± Comment Service

This monorepo contains multiple .NET microservices related to comments management.

## ðŸ“¦ Microservices

- `add-comment-ms` â€“ Add a new comment
- `edit-comment-ms` â€“ Edit existing comments
- `delete-comment-ms` â€“ Remove comments
- `list-comment-ms` â€“ Retrieve and list comments

Each microservice:
- Is independently deployable
- Has its own Dockerfile
- Uses ASP.NET Core and .NET 8

## ðŸš€ Running the stack

Use Docker Compose to run all services together:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
